The Barnacle, built in 1891, offers a glimpse of frontier life during The Era of the Bay, when all travel to and from Miami was by boat. Situated on the shore of Biscayne Bay, this was the home of Ralph Middleton Munroe, one of Coconut Grove's most charming and influential pioneers. Left in its natural state, The Barnacle Historic State Park appears much as it did in Munroe's day, complete with replicas of two of his sailboats: Egret, a 28-foot (8.5m) sharpie ketch, designed in 1886, and the Flying Proa, designed in 1898. It is a great place to enjoy simple pleasures: A tour with new or old friends; a picnic on the lawn; walking with the family dog down a tree-lined path; or just rocking in a chair on the spacious front porch and watching the sailboats go by.","editing":false,"idPartner":"5a8b4867a4433f130b439865","images":["assets/products/8366935/tb.jpg","assets/products/8366935/tb1.jpg","assets/products/8366935/tb2.jpg","assets/products/8366935/tb3.jpg"],"itemsPrices":[{"price":"0","commissionPHolder":"%","label":"Information","netPrice":"0"}],"notes":"HOURS OF OPERATION Monday - Sunday 9:00AM - 5:00PM Closed on Tuesday.

After the railroad was built, the quarry was used until the 1960s to produce exquisite pieces of decorative stone called Keystone. Today, visitors can walk along eight-foot-high quarry walls to see cross sections of the ancient coral and learn about the quarry and its operation- an important part of Florida's 20th century history. Samples of the quarry machinery have been preserved at the park. Visitors can enjoy the natural attributes of this island while strolling five, short, self-guided trails.","editing":false,"idPartner":"5a8b4867a4433f130b439865","images":["assets/products/941427/kf.jpg","assets/products/941427/kf1.jpg","assets/products/941427/kf2.jpg","assets/products/941427/kf3.jpg"],"itemsPrices":[{"price":0,"commissionPHolder":"%","label":"Information","priceNet":0,"netPrice":"0"}],"notes":"HOURS OF OPERATION Thursday - Monday 9AM - 5PM | Closed Tuesday & Wednesday\nADMISSION General admission $2.50* per person (*Includes $.50 per person Monroe County Surcharge)\nGUIDED TOUR HOURS December through April: Friday, Saturday and Sunday from 10AM - 2PM\nTOUR PRICE $2.00 (6 and up) | Children 5 years of age and younger are free.\nAMENITIES: Tours, Hiking, Picnicking, Wildlife Viewing, Visitors Center\nLOCATION: 84900 Overseas Highway, Islamorada, FL 33036","options":"<button onclick=\"angular.element(this).scope().deleteCategory('5a8b5a8ba4433f130b43986a')\"  class=\"btn btn-danger btn-xs\" ui-toggle-class=\"show inline\" target=\"#spin\"> <span class=\"text\"><i class=\"fa fa-trash\"></i></span>  <span class=\"text-active\">Cargando...</span></button> <i class=\"fa fa-spin fa-spinner hide\" id=\"spin\"></i>","productName":"Windley Key Fossil Reef Geological State Park","selected":true,"status":"active","updatedAt":"2018-03-31T11:04:43.533Z","id":"5a8b5a8ba4433f130b43986a"},{"category":["Outdoors","Attractions","Shopping","Nighlife","Family Fun","Art"],"createdAt":"2018-02-21T04:10:41.393Z","description":"Beyond the glitz and glamour of the Magic City, Miami has the colorful and artsy Wynwood neighborhood.
